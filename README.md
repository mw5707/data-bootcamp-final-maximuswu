Data Bootcamp S25 Final Project

Hello and welcome to my final project for Data Bootcamp!

For this project, I wanted to discover what variables contributed to creating a 'hit song' on Spotify and train a model to predict how popular a song might be simply based on its quantitative (tempo, track length, 'energy', etc) and qualitative (genre, artist name, etc) characteristics. 

For this project, I've separated the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling notebooks and also attached a write-up document on the side. Please email me at mw5707@nyu.edu if you might have any questions about the project. Thanks!
